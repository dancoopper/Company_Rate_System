# About 
### This is a full-stack web app I made for my dad because he needed a tool that would help him with some work he needed to do. I just finished my first year of post-secondary where I learned how to design and make databases in MySQL as well as proper format and style in HTML, CSS and JS. The whole process of thinking of a solution to the problem of having a MVP took about one day in total. I did not focus on the looks of the front end but rather on the functionality of the front end.
